# Jade Web3 App

This is a web3 app for Jade Journal, to store the journals on blockchain.

Arweave is a suitable blockchain as they can store any data, on the permaweb.

Live forever, our legacy.

## History of Jade

Jade was released in 2015, because I became a parent that year. I have been writing my diary for over 20 years, and I wish my kids will do the same on Day 1. But a newborn can't write, right? 

So I built an [iPhone app](https://jade2us.com) such that my wife and I can collaborate to write collectively for our newborn. Then handover the journal when it is time.

However, I made a bad decision to use [Parse Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse,_Inc.) as the backend database. An awesome service, yet Parse was eventually ditched by Facebook in 2017, because it didn't serve the needs of a giant corporation..

It is a lesson.

Hopefully a decentralized blockchain is much stronger for [Kate](https://just2me.com/2015/08/18/baby-kate-is-born/) & [Jade](https://just2me.com/2020/01/09/baby-jade-is-born/) journals.
